					Functions 
1. can be used as a collection of instructions 

2. can be used for mapping 
e.g. def function2 (x)
	return 2*x

- we are mapping the input (x) to the output (2*x) 
-  if you wnat to execute this function you need to call it. 

	e.g  a = funtion2(3) 
- when you run this, function2 is called which refers to (x). In this case the parameter (x) is 3 and you're output (return) is 2*x aka 2*3 which = 6 

- The variable a is therefore a return value or output. 

name1 = "Amina" 
height_m1 = 2 
weight_kg1 = 90 

name2 = "Ayda"  
height_m2 = 1.8 
weight_kg2 = 70 

name3 = "Saddeeq" 
height_m3 = 2.5
weight_kg3 = 160    

def bmi_calculator(name, height_m, weight_kg):
bmi = weight_kg/(height_m**2)
print("bmi: ")
print(bmi)
if bmi <25:
return name + " is not overweight" 
else: 
return name + " is overweight" 

resutl1 = bmi_calculator(name1, height_m1,weight_kg1)
resutl2 = bmi_calculator(name2, height_m2,weight_kg2)
resutl2 = bmi_calculator(name3, height_m3,weight_kg3)

print(result1)    
print(result2)  
print(result3)               

km = convert(miles)
#km = 1.6* miles
