			Python for beginners ch1 - What are variables? 

- A variable contains a value and acts likes a name tag. e.g. a = 1 ---> the value 1 has been assigned to a 
a refers to the value 1 

- A variable can refer to a string as well. 

- You can have more than one variable assigned to one value 
- You can also reassign a variable 
- You can assign a variable to another one 

			Example code/exercise - Swapping strings 
This explains how you can reassign variables which is useful because you can reuse them without having to rewrite long strings and values in a code. In order to be able to reuse the following variables, I'm going to assign another variable called 'temp'. 

v1 = 'first string'
v2 = 'second string' 
temp = v1
v1 = v2
v2 = temp

v1 now = second string 
v2 now = first string which is the same as temp 

print(v1) ---> second string 
print(v2) ---> first string
