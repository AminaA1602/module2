Lists in Python 

how to define a list: 

a = [3, 10, -1] - This means define a new list with the elements in [] and assign this list to a 

if you wnated to add an item to the list you need to do: 

a.append [1] - this means append the item [1] to the list (a) 

* You can have different data types in a list e.g a string, integer

* You can also add a list within another list e.g: 

a.append([1,2]) - This means you are adding the list with the elements [1,2] to the variable (a)

- If you want to delete the last item in a list you need to do: 
a.pop() 

If you want to retrieve a specific item from a specific list you need to do: 

a [0] - Here I'm basically saying go to list a and look in the first index (column) and retrieve the item that's there. NOTE: 0 is 1 in Python! 

 
*If you want to change an item in a list you need to: 

call it e.g  a[0] = 100 
print(a)

b = ["banana", "apple", "microsoft"]

Define a new varable called temp 
temp = b[0]
b[0] = b[2]
b[2] = temp 

soooooo: 

b[0], b[2], b[0] 
print(b)
