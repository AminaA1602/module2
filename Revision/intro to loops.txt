Intro for loops 

for element in a: 
	print (element) - What this is saying is, in this for block, print all the elements in it (a) 

b = [20, 10, 5]
total =  0
for element in b: 
	#print (element) - btw you can rename this. 
	total = total + e 
	print(total)
if you want to find the sum of this list : 

initialise a new variable called (total)
